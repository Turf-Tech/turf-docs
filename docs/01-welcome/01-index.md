# Introduction to Turf

-   Turf ia an Infrastructure product that enables every High-Fidelity Gamer to Leverage Web3 and Incentivise their Gameplay.

-   Turf thrive to ramp up the category of Gamer’s Economy with the Blockchain based Infrastructure facilitating the Payment System and Democratising ESports for Gaming Communities & Games.

## Why we are Infrastructure focused?

Web3, the decentralised web, is an integral part of the gamer's economy. It allows players to truly own their in-game assets through blockchain and NFTs, enabling a vibrant secondary market for virtual goods.

Web3 also introduces the concept of "play-to-earn," empowering players to earn income through gaming. It brings transparency, trust, and decentralised governance to the gamer's economy, fostering a more inclusive and democratic ecosystem. Additionally, Web3 enables interoperability, cross-game integration, and pioneering innovations, driving forward-thinking approaches to game design, hence revolutionises the gamer's economy by giving players greater control, ownership, and economic opportunities.

When it’s about game builders and companies building Arcade or racing games coming to the web3 ecosystem made them feel like an entry barrier just because of the new tech dependencies.

Popular Gaming genre like shooters, Action / Adventure, Simulation, Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, Sports and Racing. “**Are not yet a disrupted themselves to be a part of the new Internet**.“

One of the major barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology in gaming is the fact that many traditional games built on Web2 architectures cannot easily transition to Web3. This is because these games were not designed with decentralised networks in mind, and the process of retrofitting them to work on a decentralised platform can be difficult and costly.

## Major Problem

One of the major hurdles in implementing blockchain technology in gaming is the fact that many conventional Web2-based games are not readily adaptable to Web3.

-   Big companies are the only Authorities to organise ESports Events

-   That leads ESports are restricted to Top Gamers & Top Games

### # Gaming Companies

-   Not easy to switch to Web3 Infrastructure, they need to change the games ground-up.
-   Implementation of P2E Mechanisms in-game taps into a new scope of dealing with Legal & regulatory matters.
-   Gaming communities and feature requests are not yet formalised.
-   No Dedicated Marketplace for Gaming NFTs like ( Skins & In-game Assets )

### # Gamers

-   No in-game earning mechanisms that can be yielded while playing traditional popular games.
-   P2P Game assets exchanges is still a big problem and lacks trust, Inter-country transfers are still hard.
-   No marketplace to exchange assets for money. Dealing with Credit Cards are risker as lot of Credit Card thefts are looped through Gaming sites.
