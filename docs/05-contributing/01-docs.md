# Improving documentation

Thank you for visiting our repository and considering making contributions. We
appreciate your interest in helping us to create and maintain awesome tutorials
and documentation.

## Using this repo

## Reviewing technical content PRs

Some of the best content contributions come during the PR review cycles. Follow
best practices for technical content PR reviews just like you do for code
reviews.

- For in-line suggestions, use the [GitHub suggesting
  feature](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request)
  .
- The PR owner can merge in your suggested commits one at a time or in batch
  (preferred).
- When you are providing a more granular extensive review that results in more
  than 20 in-line suggestions, go ahead and check out the branch and make the
  changes yourself.

## Writing and contributing

We welcome contributions to the docs and tutorials.

## Where can I find the tutorials and docs?
