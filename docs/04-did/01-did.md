# Decentralized Identity

> A decentralized identity is a self-owned, independent identity that enables trusted data exchange.

Decentralized identity is based on a trust framework for identity management. Such decentralized identity management includes an approach to identity and access administration that allows people to generate, manage and control their personally identifiable information (PII) without a centralized third party like a registry, identity provider or certification authority.

Considered to be private and sensitive data, PII refers to the body of information about specific individuals that directly or indirectly identifies them. Usually, it combines name, address, et cetera.

With a decentralized identity, users can control their own PII and provide only the information that is required to be verified. Decentralized identity management supports an identity trust framework where users, organizations and things interact with each other transparently and securely.

## Why decentralized identity?

A decentralized identity aims to give people official proof of identity and complete ownership and control over their identities in a secure and user-friendly way.

Traditional centralized identification systems are insecure, fragmented and exclusionary. Centralized identity databases are at risk as they often become prime targets for hackers.

Decentralized digital identity addresses these issues by providing a way for digital identity to be used across multiple participating platforms without sacrificing security and the user’s experience. In a decentralized identity framework, users need only an internet connection and a device to access it.

## How decentralized identity works

The basis for decentralized identity management is the use of decentralized encrypted blockchain-based wallets.

In a decentralized identity framework, users utilize decentralized identity wallets — special apps that allow them to create their decentralized identifiers, store their PII and manage their VCs —instead of keeping identity information on numerous websites controlled by intermediaries.

While decentralized identity wallets transparently authenticate users, they also protect users' communications and data. Decentralized apps (DApps) store PII, verified identity details and the information needed to establish trust, prove eligibility or just complete a transaction. These wallets help users give and revoke access to identity information from a single source, making it faster and easier.
