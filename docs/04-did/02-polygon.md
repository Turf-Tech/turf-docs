# Turf w PolygonID

[Polygon ID](https://polygon.technology/polygon-id) is a platform for decentralized identities using zero knowledge proofs. It’s built on the iden3 protocol, which is an open source project using some common building blocks shared with Polygon’s zk rollup solutions. The iden3 protocol allows the issuers registry to be implemented in Solidity smart contracts and is compatible with any EVM based blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon and others.

Polygon ID offers on-chain verification and permissionless attestation. It’s backed by zero knowledge proofs and pluggable on the Kaleido platform. Polygon ID brings zk-backed privacy to the table, which is unique to the market.

Polygon ID has the following properties:

- Blockchain-based ID for decentralized and self-sovereign models
- Zero-knowledge native protocols for ultimate user privacy
- Scalable and private on-chain verification to boost decentralized apps and decentralized finance
- Open to existing standards and ecosystem development

Polygon ID leverages the Iden3 protocol and Circom ZK toolkit. Moving forward, both of the projects will be sponsored by Polygon while keeping the original spirit of community initiatives to provide open source protocols and tools to the broader ecosystem of developers.

“Polygon ID is private by default, offers on-chain verification and permissionless attestation. There is nothing in the digital identity space now that ticks all these boxes,” said Mihailo Bjelic, Polygon’s co-founder. “It is also a great showcase for how zero knowledge proofs can help us create a better world.”
